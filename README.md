# odin-caesar-cipher
My take on the caesar-cipher in Ruby.

This program was implemented based on the fundamental lessons
from The Odin Project's Ruby on Rails pathway.

I developed a function that gets user input.
The user input is text to be ciphered and the shift factor.
Then the function returns the cipher text based on the given information.
